# Graph View Guide

Quick tips to make your vault graph useful:

## Filters (Excluded files)
- Ignore common noise: node_modules, build outputs, maps, lockfiles, code.
- Suggested patterns:
  - node_modules/*
  - **/*.map
  - **/*.lock
  - **/.git/*
  - **/.vscode/*
  - **/dist/*
  - **/build/*
  - **/*.png, **/*.jpg, **/*.pdf

## Toggles
- Show tags: on (helps see topic clusters quickly)
- Show attachments: off (optional)
- Center on click: on

## Structure tips
- Keep hubs in Topics/ and link notes to hubs using "## See also".
- Add tags to frontmatter: tags: [topic, topic/<name>].
- Add a few cross-links between related notes to densify clusters.

## Next steps
- Create hubs for: AI, Productivity, Web Development, Business, Planning, Health.
- Add 2–3 links from each relevant note to a hub.
