## Transcript

Below is the full transcript of the provided audio source, including speaker labels:

**Scott**: Welcome to Syntax, folks. Today we're talking about RSS, which is alive and well. We're going to be talking a little bit about how CJ uses RSS because that's right, Wes is on vacation. Joining me once again is CJ. What's up, CJ?

**CJ**: Not much. I'm excited to talk about this. Uh, I've been experimenting with a lot of different ways to read RSS and, you know, just stay up to date with the news. And so, yeah, excited to to share all of my findings.

**Scott**: I'm excited because when anytime people talk about RSS I just say all right I don't I don't I I don't know if I've ever and I'm saying like even going back to the year 2000 I don't think I've ever had a good RSS setup. I used many of the popular apps at the time like was it Google reader or one of those you know

**Scott**: Google feed reader

**Scott**: I yep I used I used a lot of the apps but I never really got a good system. I'm interested to hear how you use it but also like why when and where those types of of things. So, I I'm ready to have my mind blowing. Uh my mind blowing. Yeah, my mind is uh is actively blowing, I guess. Yes. So, RSS uh it gives you a feed of stuff, yada yada yada. But, uh the feed that I'm checking the most is my Sentry feed at centry.io because it lets me know which websites or which websites, which pages have the worst user misery score. And that is accounts for a lot of things basically like how fast and how often these pages are hit. It's letting you know truly what are the pages you need to look at first and foremost if you want to improve the time that people are having on your website. What about like payments? You're getting failed payment alerts, things like that. You can keep track of all those things. Error monitoring, session replay, which allows you to see how the bug happened, tracing, code coverage. Their new platform, Seer, allows you to find the root cause of issues. And it is so very good. It is very very good and all around just improve your application and get code test coverage and all the the lovely things. Sentry also integrates with just about everything and is super easy to get started. One of my favorite things about the Sentry team is they have really prioritized like wizards. I mean I like wizards. Give me a Merlin all day. They got a Merlin in here and for anytime you want to set it up, that Merlin will go off and just update your code with whatever platform you're using to get you set up with century without you having to npm install a whole bunch of stuff. You just say npm create whatever. Uh I'll have to look at each individual one. But if it's got a Merlin in it, I'm I'm around for that. So CJ RSS, let's get back to the topic. Thank you, Sentry, for producing sponsoring this episode. Uh let's get into it. RSS, what what's up with it? What's up with RS?

**CJ**: Sure. I think we'll we'll start we'll take a step back. I'll define what RSS is for anybody because you probably heard it before. Give a little bit of history. and like what's out there and then talk about how how I use it. Um, so it stands for really simple syndication and it's it's really really simple syndication and it is a uh typically you see it as an XML format and essentially it is just a a list of items. Those items could be anything and any website can publish a feed and uh there are a few different types but typically they're all just grouped into this term of RSS but RSS was the original standard. There's also atom feeds. Now, there's JSON feeds or JSON web feeds. Uh, but pretty much any RSS reader you come across is going to be able to read from any one of these formats. And the idea is a website can expose a feed and basically list what is new newly available on that website or or it could even be a history of everything available from that website or that thing. So, syntax has an RSS feed. Uh, feed.sax.fm I think that's the URL. Let me try it really quick. That's the one. And If you go there,

**Scott**: the RSS feed I've spent the most amount of time with. I'll tell you that.
